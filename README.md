## Overview
This repository contains network configuration files generated by [Intent-ify](https://intent-ify.com) for implementing "Deploy collapsed core with segmented VLANs: Core Banking (192.168.10.0/24), ATMs (192.168.20.0/24), Tellers (192.168.30.0/24), Guest WiFi (192.168.40.0/24), Security/Cameras (192.168.50.0/24), VoIP (192.168.60.0/24), Management (192.168.100.0/24). Implement PCI-DSS compliance with firewall ACLs, AES-256 encryption, IPS/IDS, 802.1X authentication, and audit logging. Configure Cisco ISR 4331 router, Catalyst 9300 core, ASA 5516-X firewall, 5520 wireless controller. Enable QoS for voice, redundant connectivity (100Mbps primary/50Mbps 4G backup), automated vulnerability scanning, and regulatory compliance monitoring." on cisco  devices.
